#  Nutq Darwin



## Known Bugs
- macOS
    - undoing is weird. removing focus seems to work
    - navigation is weird. will need to look for better interop between cocoa and swiftui in future
- iOS
- general
    - cannot delete last scheme. Appears to be SwiftUI issue, hard to get around.

Tomorrow:
    research: 
    breakout mentors, get lessons done
    nutq: move to markdown instead, i think this will be a lot easier in the long run

#  Nutq Darwin


## disclaimers
- Uses NSUbiqutous as well as rather tense because I wanted these on my system. 

## Known Bugs
- macOS
    - sidebar cannot properly do prev scheme
    - sidebar cannot enter to edit scheme name (workaround: swipe left)
- iOS
- general
    - cannot delete last scheme. Appears to be SwiftUI issue, hard to get around.

- synchronize with iCloud
- for ipadOS and iOS has a widget
- macos is where we do the main writing, but maybe editable on ipadOS and iOS as well
- Organized under schemas (work, personal, education, monocurl, etc)
- from there we can either have assignments with deadlines
    - multiple states (not started, finished, need to turn in)
    - each assignment has a tree hierarchy of subassignments (so folders)
- uses vim like commands for navigating
- at the top we have a list of important stuff to do
- so we can have events, assignments, and procedures (stuff like monocurl)
    - procedures (maybe everything) can also have plans/descriptions
 
 - Procedure (infinite interval)
 - assignment (negative ray)
 - reminder (positive ray, notification on leading edge...)
 - event (line segment)
 
 - Have home page + scheme pages
    - home page has a list of producedures (maybe based on priority). Also has overall calendar
    - each scheme page has procedures + tree view of assignments and stuff
    - so different views: calendar, procedure, etc
